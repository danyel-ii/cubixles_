# Security Policy

Last updated: 2026-01-28

## Reporting a vulnerability
Please report security issues privately.

Preferred:
- GitHub Security Advisories ("Report a vulnerability" on the repo)

Alternative:
- Email: dh4wes@gmail.com

## Scope
This policy applies to:
- Smart contracts under `contracts/src/`
- Server routes under `app/api/`
- Client app under `app/` and `app/_client/` (including `/what-it-do`)

## Response targets
- Acknowledgment: within 3 business days
- Triage: within 7 business days
- Fix or mitigation plan: within 30 days

## Coordinated disclosure
We ask that reporters keep details private until a fix or mitigation is available.

## Dependency advisory note
See `docs/security.md` for the current dependency advisory notes (including the dismissed
`elliptic` alert rationale).
